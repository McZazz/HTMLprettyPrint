# HTMLprettyPrint

Simply enter some html into the "prettyHTML_input.txt" formatted how you want it to appear on your tutorial, how-to site or other resource where you need pretty printed and colored HTML code to display on a webpage. Run the "prettyHTML.py" script and then copy the new text found in the "prettyHTML_output.txt" file and paste it into your website's html, in a div with the class of "code". The supplied css will do the rest to get you started.

In order to adjust font sizes, or use a different monospace font (the character width may be different than what I used here) the "tabs" area in CSS must be re-generated, use the tmaker.py to do this, adjusting the increment variable, then copy pasting from the "prettyPY_output.txt" into the CSS, replacing the "tabs" area there.

From standard html in a text file, to this displayed on your website (colors are found at the top of the CSS file for modification):
