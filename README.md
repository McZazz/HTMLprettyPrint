# HTMLprettyPrint

This can be considered a workspace for development. Simply enter some html into the "prettyHTML_input.txt" formatted how you want it to appear on your tutorial, how-to site or other resource where you need pretty printed and colored HTML code to display on a webpage. Run the "prettyHTML.py" script and then copy the new text found in the "prettyHTML_output.txt" file and paste it into your website's html, in a div with the class of "code". The supplied css will do the rest to get you started.
